# EE360C Programming Assignments

This repository contains the code for all 3 of the programs we had to write in EE360C (Algorithms) during the Fall 2021 Semester at the University of Texas at Austin.

### Program 1

This assignment was an application of the Gale Shapley algorithm, where we were tasked to optimally match companies to interns based on their respective preferences lists.

### Program 2

In this assignment, we were first tasked to implement a min-heap from scratch, without using the PriorityQueue data structure provided by Java. Utilizing that heap, we were tasked to program an application of Dijkstra's Shortest Paths Algorithm as well as Prim's Algorithm to find an MST for the provided graph.

### Program 3

In this assignment, we were tasked to solve a problem which required dynamic programming. Given the position of houses (as floating point numbers), we were tasked to find the optimal locations to place 'k' food stations to optimally serve each of the 'n' houses to minimize the response time. After calculating the optimal response time, we were tasked with figuring out the optimal food station locations that resulted in the optimal response time.
